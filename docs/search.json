    "text": "Developing a data analysis is hard, it can involve many mis-steps and changes of mind from redoing of little bits here and there that weren’t quite right the first time, to introducing new ideas or removing whole sections that didn’t work out. This iterative process is completely in-line with all other aspects of research and means that we have a personal need to be able to record exactly what we’ve done with high accuracy, and high reproducibility. It is also our scientific responsibility and an aspect of scientific integrity that we are clear and open about the methods we use as they are key in the interpretations and understanding of the results that we get. In the jargon of the field we think of this as ‘keeping a proper lab book’, but when it comes to using a computer, what we need to record, when is not often clear nor is it sometimes easy to do so. As a result the methods sections of many reports, theses and papers report scientific computing in a vague and uninterpretable way, making statements like ‘tests were done in Excel’ or ‘GenStat was used to perform \\(t\\)-tests’, or ‘a custom R script was used’. These nebulous reports are useless for anyone trying to understand exactly what was done and reports using them are unreproducible. That they pass reviewers so often is a clear indication of the failure of reviewing of methods. In practice these sorts of write ups are no better and no more informative than announcing that statistical analyses were done with a magic spell.\nA major failing of computer graphical interfaces is that they do not make it easy for us to repeat actions, which is ironic as computers are excellent at repeating instructions very quickly. Scripts and programs are required to get the best reproducibility out of our computers, but scripts in R and Python (and any other computer language) are not easily read by people, even those with a great deal of experience in programming. Very quickly reproducible scripts become unusable lumps of code because users can’t tell what is in them and what they are supposed to do, a phenomenon that has it’s own acronym - WORN - write once, read never.\nLiterate programming is the skill of writing code that is readable and understandable, often without the need to read the actual code in any depth. This is a very useful day-to-day skill to have when working in science as multidisciplinary teams abound. It is also useful when switching from project to project as we can understand what we were doing in a new project and get going again quickly. Using literate programming also eases our duty to report clearly and openly what we did in our analysis as the task of writing the code and explaining what we did are accomplished simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by @AllisonHorst\n\n\n\n\nIn this course we’ll learn how to create a literate programming document in two popular data science languages, R and Python. The two systems share a common core and much of what you learn for one will be applicable to the other."

    "text": "1.2 Markdown\nThe process of adding annotations, like corrections or notes and comments to a physical or digital document is sometimes called ’marking it up. In processing digital documents, a language that adds tags to text to format them is called a markup language. Web pages are all written in a markup language called HTML (hypertext markup language) and it puts tags around elements to format them. Here for example is the markup for making text bold.\nI am regular text. But <b>I am bold!</b>\nand when you put that test through a rendering program like a web browser, it shows up like this:\nI am regular text. But I am bold!\nAs you can see the bits in the <b></b> are formatted as per the tags surrounding them (the <b><\\b> tags mean bold). Markdown performs a similar job, it is a lightweight markup language (hence mark-down), that can do a lot of formatting, and unlike HTML still looks readable in raw text without rendering it. It is a simple base format and can easily be converted into many formats.\n\n1.2.1 Basic markdown tags\nHere is a selection of basic markdown tags.\n## This is a heading\n\nHere is some regular text, this is **bold**.\n\n### This is a different, lower level heading (Note the number of `#`)\n\n    1. I am a member in a list\n    2. I am another member in the list\n\nHere is an image tag\n\n![A Random Image](https://picsum.photos/200/300)\nWhen rendered, this is going to look like this\n\n\n\n\n\nMore markdown tags are available, hopefully these give you an idea of how markdown works. Here is a helpful ‘cheat-sheet’ with many more tags you can use, RStudio RMarkdown Cheat Sheet."

    "text": "1.3 R Markdown\nR Markdown is an extension of markdown with R mixed in. The markdown syntax is extended using special blocks that contain R code. When it comes to rendering time, the R is run and the results pushed into the rendered document. By mixing these together we get a tool which we can use to get a literate programmed document that can fulfil all our responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by @AllisonHorst\n\n\n\n\nThe R code block we mix in with our regular markdown is structured with ``` (backticks, not quotes) and {r}, in practice a block looks like this\n```{r}\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nAny R code can go in the blocks, and the program remembers state between blocks so that stuff you do in earlier blocks is remembered in later ones.\n\n1.3.1 Using R Markdown in RStudio\nRStudio provides a lot of tools for creating RMarkdown documents easily. To get a basic template document you can use the menu’s File -> New File -> R Markdown. On doing this you see a dialogue box, usually you want to set the options as in the figure below (you can put your name and a title in the relevant boxes )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you do this you get a new draft document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor you to do\n\n\n\nUsing RStudio, create a new RMarkdown document. Read it and compare it with what goes below.\n\n\n\n1.3.1.1 Header Information\nThe first bit of the draft document is a bit of YAML markup that captures some information about the document. You don’t need to change anything here if you don’t want to, though it can be useful to use the information at this link to set the date automatically Dates in RMarkdown\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nauthor: \"Dan MacLean\"\ndate: \"20/04/2021\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Setup Block\nThe next part is the automatically created set up block\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\nThis is a standard R block with some options set. The first bit ````{r setup,} is the standard block start, but this one is named setup. You don’t need to name each block, but it can be helpful when bugs start to appear. The next bit include=FALSE is an option that tells the RMarkdown renderer not to include the code or it’s output in the final document, this is because this is just setup code that we don’t want messing up our nice output. Then we have the code that this block runs knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) which set up some formatting options. You can use this block for any bits of setup code that you don’t want in the rest of your document.\n\n\n1.3.1.3 Markdown and R blocks\nThe other blocks are the document’s standard code and text blocks. Read them then perform this task\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor you to do\n\n\n\nUsing RStudio, render the document using the Knit button at the top of the editor pane.\nNote how the code and results, including plots are mixed in the resulting document.\nMake some text edits and change the plot titles, then re-knit the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Conclusion\nThis all there really is to RMarkdown documents, they are a very easy to use tool for keeping your analyses readable and reproducible. Inspect the cheat sheet a little further for tips on what more you can do in RMarkdown, RStudio RMarkdown Cheat Sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoundup\n\n\n\nRMarkdown documents are excellent tools for creating readable, attractive and dynamic reproducible literate programming documents."
